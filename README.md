## Overview
This is just a fun project which is designed to utilize remaining capacity in old batteries while adding some decorative [Blinkenlights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights) to your shop or office.

Many battery-powered devices complain of low battery when there is still significant usable capacity left in the cells. Such cells can often power this circuit for many days or even a few weeks as the circuit only requires a few milliamperes and utilizes a boost regulator to maintain a constant supply voltage.

The circuit board fits on a dual AA cell holder and also has screw terminals for connection to other sources of power.

For more information, see the [firmware here](https://github.com/JChristensen/larson84).  
PC boards can be ordered from [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/H8Wv3avv).  
A bill of materials is available at [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=ef0590339b) and also in this repo.
